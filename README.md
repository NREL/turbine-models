# NREL Wind Turbine Power Curve Archive
## Welcome to the repository for the wind turbine power curve archive.

The intention of this repositiory is to provide power curves and key data for commonly used turbine models in industry the R&D community. 

## Structure
Tabular power (and thrust when available) curve data is stored in the following folders:
- Distributed Wind Turbines
- Offshore Wind Turbines
- Onshore Wind Turbines

Here you can find .csv files with the following turbine data:
1. Power curve
2. Thrust curve (when available)
3. Cp curve (when available)
4. Ct curve (when available)

## Documentation
Each turbine included in the repository is documented in detail:
https://nrel.github.io/turbine-models/

The name of the turbine on the .csv file with tabular data should match up with a corresponding documentation page.
