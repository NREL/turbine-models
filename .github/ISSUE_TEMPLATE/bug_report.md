<!--
Thank you for taking the time to report a bug. If you aren't certain whether an issue
is a bug, please first open a Discussion. Before submitting, please reread your
description to ensure that other readers can reasonably understand the issue
you're facing and the impact on your workflow or results.

IMPORTANT NOTES

1. Replace all example text (contained in "<>") or anywhere specifically commenting to replace the
   text, leaving any guiding HTML comments in place (formatted like this large block so it won't
   show up in your Bug Report text.)
2. Use GH flavored markdown: https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax,
   especially for code snippets, which should look like the following:
   ```python
   a = 1
   b = 2
   print(a + b)
   ```
3. Please be as thorough as possible when describing what went wrong, and what was expected from a
   correct solution. The amount of information required to describe the bug may differ, but more
   information is always helpful to ensure you receive the help you need.
