<!--
Thank you for taking the time to suggest a feature. Before submitting,
please reread your description to ensure that other readers can reasonably
understand the motivation and proposed solution.

IMPORTANT NOTES

1. Leave all HTML comments in place (formatted like this large block so it won't show up in
   your Feature Request text.)
2. Use GH flavored markdown: https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax,
   especially for code snippets, which should look like the following:
   ```python
   a = 1
   b = 2
   print(a + b)
   ```
3. Please be as thorough as possible when describing what the proposed enhancement or feature should
   do, including any finer details to guide implementation.
